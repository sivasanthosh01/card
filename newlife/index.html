	<h1>HAPPINESS</h1>
		<p>
		Every day of your life is a new beginning, not just the first day of the year.<br>
		You can make Daily Resolutions, not just New Year Resolutions. Any day is suitable for making them.<br>
		Regard every day as the beginning of your new, better, and happier life. <br>
		Start every day of the year with feelings of happiness and with the anticipation that great and wonderful things are going to happen.<br>
		Regardless of your circumstances, begin every day of the year with a smile, hope and expectations.<br>
		You are not cheating yourself, because this attitude, if you persevere with it, would make you a more positive and happy person.<br>
		Every day, restate your goals and your decisions for your new, happy and successful life. <br>
		At the same time, be open to new ideas and opportunities, and for ways to achieve your goals.
